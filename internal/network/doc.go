// Package network provides the actual logic of maintaining the protocol
//
// As opposed to protocol, which contains definitions related
// to the abstract messages, this package actually deals with
// maintaining the tcp connections themselves.
// The main way of interacting with this package is through
// the SwarmHandle type.
